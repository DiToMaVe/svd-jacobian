# svd-jacobian

DESCRIPTION:
      Computation of  the Jacobian of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for complex- and real-valued matrices. This task can be done       based on analytical expressions or using numerical differentiation based on finite differences.

      The file 'example_svd_jacobian.m' contains some examples compairing the analytical method with the numerical method.
